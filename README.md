Files
1. CodeBook.md is a code book which describes the data, their associated variables, and the necessary changes that have been done to tidy up the data.

2. run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
  a. Merges the training and the test sets to create a merged data set.
  b. Filters the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  d. Appropriately labels the newly merged data set with their corresponding descriptive variable names.
  e. From the collated data, it creates a separate .txt file from the tidied data set containing the means of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
